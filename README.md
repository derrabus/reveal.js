# The Dark Side of Traits

This is a talk I prepared for the International php Conference 2012.

## Abstract

With the release 5.4, php gave us traits - so let's start using them! But does it always make sense? In this talk, we
will have a look at some use cases for traits. But we will also have a look at the drawbacks, especially regarding
maintainability and testability.
